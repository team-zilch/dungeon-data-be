## Motivation
A short description of the motivation behind the creation and maintenance of the project. This should explain **why** the project exists.

## Description:
 This application will serve as a user hub for dungeon masters to be able to obtain the most up to date monster information on playing cards. The user will be able to enter their location and be given a listing of current events/news in their location. The user will be able to scroll through the monster compendium

 ##Project Scope
 The MVP for this project is to give the user access to monster cards created from the dungeons and dragon’s API data which allows for current monster information versus a static physical deck of cards which could potentially be outdated with updates. The user will have the ability to favorite cards which will be displayed first at the top of the page underneath the current events based off of the user’s location.

 ##User stories
 MVP User Stories
   As a user, I'd like to find a welcome page that is clearly designed so I can find the information I am looking for.
   As a user, I'd like to be able to easily find information about the creators of the application.
   As a user, I'd like to be able to find game information in case I need to reference a rule and even learn about the game for the first time.
   As a user, I'd like to have live updated cards for the dungeon master to refer to during game play versus flipping through cards.
   As a user, I'd like to be able to search for any card beyond the cards initially presented to me.

 ##Stretch Goal User Stories
   As a user, I’d like to know about current and upcoming events – google api for user location
   As a user, I'd like to be able to filter the cards by abilities or other monster details.
   As a user, I'd like to be able to sort the cards by monster.

## Features
What makes your project stand out?

## Installation of Server

This is a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) module available through the
[npm registry](https://www.npmjs.com/).

Before installing, [download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
Node.js 10.15.3 or higher is required.

Installation is done using the
[`npm install` command](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-npm-packages-locally):

```bash
$ npm install express```

Follow [our installing guide](http://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html)
for more information.


## Quick Start
## How to use?

 The quickest way to get started with express is to utilize the executable [`express(1)`](https://github.com/expressjs/generator) to generate an application as shown below:

 Install the executable. The executable's major version will match Express's:

```bash
$ npm install -g express-generator@4```

 Install dependencies:

```bash
$ npm install```

##Conflict plan
 What will your group do when it encounters conflict?
   Majority vote determines course of action
 How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
   Communication. As we’re all adults, it shouldn’t be an issue to directly communicate with any trouble that arises. Address cordially person to person initially. If trouble continues, involve group. If trouble continues, involve TA or instructor.
 What is your process to resolve conflicts?
   Approach problem head on, one on one. Involve group if need arises. Involve TA’s/instructor if mechanisms require.
 How and when will you escalate the conflict if your attempts are unsuccessful?
   First level of escalation is to the full group. Problems should be taken to full group for vote immediately if one on one cannot be resolved. If there is still issue after group vote, TA’s/Instructor should be requested for mediation immediately. Better to resolve any conflict as soon as possible to prevent prolonged disruption to project.

##Communication Plan
 How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?
   Communication after hours will be through the group slack channel.
 What is your strategy for ensuring everyones voices are heard?
   Round table discussion on feature aspects.
 How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?
   Everyone will have a chance to speak up, all opinions will be sought before decisions are finalized. Ultimately, a group vote will determine a course of action.

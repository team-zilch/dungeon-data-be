## Project Name: Dungeon Data
## Developers: 
David Marchante, 
Kush Shrestha, 
Chaitanya Narukulla, 
William Fritts.

## Description:
 This application will serve as a user hub for dungeon masters to be able to obtain the most up to date monster information on playing cards. The user will be able to enter their location and be given a listing of current events/news in their location. The user will be able to scroll through the monster compendium

 ##Project Scope
 The MVP for this project is to give the user access to monster cards created from the dungeons and dragon’s API data which allows for current monster information versus a static physical deck of cards which could potentially be outdated with updates. The user will have the ability to favorite cards which will be displayed first at the top of the page underneath the current events based off of the user’s location.

 ##User stories
 MVP User Stories
   As a user, I'd like to find a welcome page that is clearly designed so I can find the information I am looking for.
   As a user, I'd like to be able to easily find information about the creators of the application.
   As a user, I'd like to be able to find game information in case I need to reference a rule and even learn about the game for the first time.
   As a user, I'd like to have live updated cards for the dungeon master to refer to during game play versus flipping through cards.
   As a user, I'd like to be able to search for any card beyond the cards initially presented to me.

 ##Stretch Goal User Stories
   As a user, I’d like to know about current and upcoming events – google api for user location

   As a user, I'd like to be able to sort the cards by monster.

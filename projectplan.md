##Project Scope
  The MVP for this project is to give the user access to monster cards created from the dungeons and dragon's API data which allows for current monster information versus a static physical deck of cards which could potentially be outdated with updates. The user will have the ability to favorite cards which will be displayed first at the top of the page underneath the current events based off of the user's location. 
##Conflict plan
  What will your group do when it encounters conflict?
    Majority vote determines course of action
  How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
    Communication. As we're all adults, it shouldn't be an issue to directly communicate with any trouble that arises. Address cordially person to person initially. If trouble continues, involve group. If trouble continues, involve TA or instructor. 
  What is your process to resolve conflicts?
    Approach problem head on, one on one. Involve group if need arises. Involve TA's/instructor if mechanisms require. 
  How and when will you escalate the conflict if your attempts are unsuccessful?
    First level of escalation is to the full group. Problems should be taken to full group for vote immediately if one on one cannot be resolved. If there is still issue after group vote, TA's/Instructor should be requested for mediation immediately. Better to resolve any conflict as soon as possible to prevent prolonged disruption to project. 

##Communication Plan
  How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?
    Communication after hours will be through the group slack channel. 
  What is your strategy for ensuring everyone's voices are heard?
    Round table discussion on feature aspects. 
  How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?
    Everyone will have a chance to speak up, all opinions will be sought before decisions are finalized. Ultimately, a group vote will determine a course of action.
